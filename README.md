### OpeningApp-Assessment

Built using Node.js, Express, and the Gmail API, this app provides a dashboard to toggle the autoresponder service, ensuring timely responses without manual intervention. Integrated with OAuth2 for secure Gmail authentication. ðŸ“§ðŸ¤–ðŸ› .

## Libraries and Technologies Specification

Below is a detailed specification of the libraries and technologies used in the project:

- **dotenv (^16.3.1)**:
  - `dotenv` is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. It's beneficial in separating configurations from the codebase, thereby making the app more secure and easily configurable.

- **ejs (^3.1.9)**:
  - `ejs` stands for "Embedded JavaScript Templates." It's a templating engine that lets developers generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. We use it for rendering dynamic content on the front-end.

- **express (^4.18.2)**:
  - `express` is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the development of web servers.

- **express-session (^1.17.3)**:
  - `express-session` is a middleware for Express applications that allows us to manage sessions. It's instrumental in persisting user data across requests, such as authentication tokens in our use case.

- **googleapis (^128.0.0)**:
  - `googleapis` is Google's officially supported Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs. We use it to interact with the Gmail API for automating email functionalities.

- **nodemon (^3.0.1)**:
  - `nodemon` is a utility that monitors for any changes in the Node.js application and automatically restarts the server. It's particularly useful during the development phase, reducing the need for manual server restarts.

## Gmail Autoresponder App

This application automatically responds to incoming Gmail messages with a predefined message. Once authenticated, it periodically checks for new emails and sends auto-responses.

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone (https://github.com/itsBURO/OpeningApp-Assessment
   cd OpeningApp-Assessment
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Add the following variables:
   ```
